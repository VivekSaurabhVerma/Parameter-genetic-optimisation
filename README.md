# Parameter-genetic-optimisation
Hyperparameter optimisation of ML models using genetic algorithm

Benefits of using a such algorithm:
 - It is not necessary to specify all the test values as with gridSearchCV, just the min and max values. Then, the search is done in the whole interval
 - The space swept by the genetic algorithm is much larger than that of a gridSearchCV
 - An optimal solution is found relatively quickly (within minutes)
 - The parameters of the final solution are stored in a text file
